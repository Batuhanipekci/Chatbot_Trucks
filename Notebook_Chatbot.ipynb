    "This notebook demonstrates my solution to the recruitment exam of Tracks GmbH for a Data Scientist position. It is aimed to deliver a clear explanation of the steps that are taken during the process; followed by a short discussion of what could be done in order to improve the effectiveness of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbot can be started by running the script chatbot_trucks.py on the terminal. Test files for cases discussed in the seventh section are also given in the same folder. The output will always be written in the file records.txt, in the same name, replacing the results of a preceding test.\n",

    "\n",
    "We need to build a small interactive system (Chat Bot) to identify trucks, their specification and number in particular fleet. \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Customer is Fleet Owner or Fleet Manager.\n",
    "* End result of conversation should be a list of trucks with their specifications and numbers.\n",

    "My approach consists of building a data frame of truck manufacture and model names to correct misspellings, or prevent irrelevant entries. This step is very important, because we would like to gather data from the fleet managers in the cleanest way possible. The data frame has taken the function of a 'corpus' that directs the decision making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is scraped, cleaned, and tokenized in the simplest possible way, given the expectations from the task. The text is normalized without using lemmatizer of stemmer, becuase there was no grammer structure to exploit as the data set contains only the names of trucks. A rule-based similarity measure (derived from Levenshtein distance) is calculated to compare user inputs with the available data frame of trucks. There is no statistical or machine learning, the system works only by heuristics. The output is attempted to be returned as human-readable as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chat bot ChatForTrucks() is constructed by considering various scenarios such as (1) if the user inputs matches with a truck model that is in our database; (2) if the user input does not match exactly, but the name of the manufacturer could be extracted, although the model name might not exist in the database; (3) if the user misspells the name of the manufacturer; (4) if the user throws something irrelevant to trucks; either by randomly writing letters, or enters a character when he/she is expected to write an integer. In addition to infering which truck the fleet manager is writing about, the knowledge on the fleet number and the specification (the total axle size) is gathered. After commanding in terminal to exit the script, the information that are gathered on the trucks are written in a file in the 'txt' format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cases (1), (2), (3) are dealt with figuring out the most similar words to the input in a selective way. The case (4) is solved by skipping the erroneous entries which is done simply by breaking the process if the maximal similarity to a user input is attained by more than one candidates. It is the place when human assistance is needed, and the fleet manager is directed to an actual human."

    "A similarity measure is the inverse of the scaled Levenshtein distance. It is only one of the available measures and a very old one. Nevertheless, it does the function of correcting misspellings in an effective way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other (See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance). In this application, it is scaled by the maximum length of compared words, so that it always remains between 0 and 1 and is comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "More advanced similarity measures are obtained by taking the cosine distance between word embeddings trained by some neural network, or the cosine distance between TF-IDF vectors (mostly applies to sentences). If a more advanced understanding of the text was required, those techniques would give more realistic interpretations. "
